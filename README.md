Python ManaTools starts from the experience of tools and framework 
written in Perl, since most systemd and dbus API are python based 
instead a this way seemed to be natural.

Python ManaTools aim is to help in writing tools based on libYui 
(Suse widget abstraction library), to be collected under the same
ManaTool hat and hopefully with the same look and feel.

Every output modules can of course be run using QT, Gtk or ncurses 
interface.
